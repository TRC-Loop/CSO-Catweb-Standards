# Naming Everything (Case)

## Formats

| Naming Convention       | Example            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| camelCase                | myVariableName     | First word lowercase, subsequent words capitalized for readability.         |
| snake_case               | my_variable_name   | All lowercase with underscores separating words.                            |
| SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE     | MY_VARIABLE_NAME   | All uppercase with underscores, typically used for constants.               |
| PascalCase               | MyVariableName     | Each word starts with a capital letter.         |

### `camelCase`

camelCase is a naming convention where the first word is lowercase and each subsequent word starts with a capital letter, improving readability (e.g., `myVariableName`).

### `snake_case`

snake_case is a naming convention where words are written in lowercase and separated by underscores for clarity (e.g., `my_variable_name`).

#### `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE is a naming convention that's based on snake_case where all letters are uppercase and words are separated by underscores, typically used for constants (e.g., `MY_VARIABLE_NAME`).

### `PascalCase`

PascalCase is a naming convention where each word starts with a capital letter and no separators are used, often for class names (e.g., `MyVariableName`).


## Content

### Variables

Local (`l!`) and Object (`o!`) variables use `camelCase` or `snake_case`.
Constant (Global) Variables use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

### Functions

Functions follow a similar pattern to variables, they use `camelCase` or `snake_case`

### UI Elements (UITree)

UI Elements in the UITree use `PascalCase`.

### Tables

Not yet defined. Use `kebab-case` for now. (eg. `my-test-table`)

## Reason

By standardizing the basic naming of everything, it's easy to see what is what. (eg. `MAX_VALUE` is surely a constant)
